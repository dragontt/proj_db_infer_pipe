# proj_db_infer_pipe

This project is an integration of regulatory network inference algorithms and motif inference algorithms. The networks are inferred from expression data ( microarray / RNA-seq) using NetProphet and BART. The DNA binding motifs are inferred from motif database using integrated information of DBD similarity and network correlation, or are inferred using de novo motif inference algorithm (FIRE).
