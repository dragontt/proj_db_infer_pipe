""" 
Bidirectional normalization maps distributions and combines rankings.
Specifically, the algorithm maps Distribution A to B (served as the base), then 
combines the scores of normalized Distribution A and base B, and computes a ranked 
list of the combined scores. Repeat the same procedure to map Distribution B to A, 
yielding another ranked list. Finally average the two ranked lists as the normalized output.
